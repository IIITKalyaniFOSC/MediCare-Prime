1. Please read the contributing guidelines XD

2. These are the ways you can contribute to this repository:
* Add a new disease model
* Improve existing models
* Improve UI
* Fix anything else that catches your eye
* Suggestions to the maintainers

3. If you see an issue already created, that you think you can resolve, comment on it and ask the maintainers to assign it to you. We will be more than glad to do so :)

5. Commit message should be of the stated syntax. Use only absolute verbs like **Create, Update, etc and no past or future tenses like creating/created.**

6. Add comments to codes. This increases readability. However do not raise issues or PRs only to add comments.

7. When naming the functions or variables use meaningful names instead of just random ones. Preferrably, refer to similar files or functions to get an idea.

8. Every PR would be reviewed before it gets approved to merge.
